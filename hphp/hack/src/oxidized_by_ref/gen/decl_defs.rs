/// A substitution context contains all the information necessary for
/// changing the type of an inherited class element to the class that is
/// inheriting the class element. It's best illustrated via an example.
///
/// ```
/// class A<Ta1, Ta2> { public function test(Ta1 $x, Ta2 $y): void {} }
///
/// class B<Tb> extends A<Tb, int> {}
///
/// class C extends B<string> {}
/// ```
///
/// The method `A::test()` has the type (function(Ta1, Ta2): void) in the
/// context of class A. However in the context of class B, it will have type
/// (function(Tb, int): void).
///
/// The substitution that leads to this change is [Ta1 -> Tb, Ta2 -> int],
/// which will produce a new type in the context of class B. It's subst_context
/// would then be:
///
/// ```
/// { sc_subst            = [Ta1 -> Tb, Ta2 -> int];
///   sc_class_context    = 'B';
///   sc_from_req_extends = false;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The `sc_from_req_extends` field is set to true if the context was inherited
/// via a require extends type. This information is relevant when folding
/// `dc_substs` during inheritance. See Decl_inherit module.
